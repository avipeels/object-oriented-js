# OOJS Features
1. Encapsulation
    Putting variables and functions in a class or object. Then variables become *properties* and functions become *methods*. **Reduce the complexity and increase the reusability**
2. Abstraction
    Avoiding showing inner complexity to outside world and expose only what is needed. It provides simpler interface and reduce the impact of change **Reduce the complexity and reduce the impact of change**
3. Inheritance
    Allows us to **avoid redundant code**
4. Polymorphism
    This will allow us to **avoid long if and else or switch case statements**

Its replacement of functional programming. Which leads to sphagetti code as the code grows.

OO JS will club the variable and functions in to a unit called Object.
